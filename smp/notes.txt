It gives invalid stack pointer. I don't know why, and I couldn't understand where it trying to jump. So I will try to write it with my hands again, it was an sample.

It gives in here calles as:
[00:00:42.916,000] <err> os: >>> ZEPHYR FATAL ERROR 0: CPU exception on CPU 0
[00:00:42.916,000] <err> os: Current thread: 0x3fcc8880 (mcumgr smp)
[00:00:43.042,000] <err> os: Halting system

I don't know how to solve it but i did everything i could. I trace this error by calling:
xtensa-esp32-elf-addr2line -e /build/zephyr/zephyr.elf 0x3fcc8880

And it gave this answer: 
static struct k_work_q smp_work_queue;

And I tried to size up of some configs:
CONFIG_MCUMGR_TRANSPORT_WORKQUEUE_STACK_SIZE=8192
CONFIG_MCUMGR_TRANSPORT_NETBUF_COUNT=16
CONFIG_BT_HCI_TX_STACK_SIZE=8192

but it gave no answer, still same error continues.

I changed CONFIG_MCUMGR_TRANSPORT_WORKQUEUE_STACK_SIZE to 4096 and BT_LONG_WQ_STACK_SIZE to 8196 in Kconfig (zephyr/subsys/bluetooth/host/Kconfig) and it solved my problem. Now it works.

Also I disabled all LOG_ERR and LOG_INF.
Changed zephyr/subsys/mgmt/mcumgr/transport/Kconfig.bluetooth menuconfig MCUMGR_TRANSPORT_BT to config MCUMGR_TRANSPORT_BT

So I moved my sensor project into this project and make thread for running smoothly, it prints into uart not shell, I'm gonna fix it.

It's done BLE can just one request and answer so i gave it once.

I moved to wifi-udp transfer but it gave:

AI told my it can be rx buffer size overflow
